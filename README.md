# Strack - CS50X Final Project
Strack is a web application made using Flask, SQLite3 and Bootstrap. When you create an account you get 3 default accounts but you can add as many as you want.
The purpose of the app is to track your finances by adding income and expenses to different accounts while being able to check your total balance.
You can also search for any entry you've done and filter by date or amount in the operations menu.
